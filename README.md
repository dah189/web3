# web3

#### This is the code for my assignment 3 in Web Technologies & Standards course.

The Web3 uses MVC to build a simple login system. This project can be imported in NetBeans IDE.
I use the Servlet, Derby DB, JavaBean and some simple JSP.
In this project you could register your own account and login to the homepage. The database would reserve your datas.
